This PDS contains a stack of XMITed PDSes. They all
need to be restored via the RECEIVE command, by
running the job XMIT6 (after reading the comments
in it) or similar. You probably want to create two 
aliases - one for GCC (the compiler proper), and one 
for PDPCLIB (the C runtime library) before doing so. 
XMIT1 provides an example of that.

After restoration, you may wish to run GCC.JCL(EXAMPLE)
to compile an example C program, after the usual site 
customizations.

For further information, please see GCC.DOC(GCCMVS)
after the restoration.

Note that XMIT2-5 and 7 do not need to be run, and are
only for reference purposes, for people who received
the XMIT as a zip file on the PC.

You may wish to delete the one or two XMIT files
that were created during this process, as they
are only useful when trying to transport GCCMVS.
XMIT8 is provided for that purpose.

Note that the "GCC" module is a 31-bit version of the 
compiler, so if you are running MVS/370 it won't work,
and you should instead use "GCC370" which is a 24-bit
module. The 31-bit version should work fine as-is on
z/OS, OS/390, MVS/XA and MVS/380. Also note that 
although the compiler is 31-bit, by default it produces
24-bit modules. If you wish to change this to 31-bit,
then after installation read GCC.DOC(GCCMVS) where
there are instructions for running STAGE4.
