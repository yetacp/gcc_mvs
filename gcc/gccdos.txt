To build GCC for 32-bit MSDOS (aka PDOS/386),
you need to change gencomp.bat and stdcompp.bat
(just at the top) then run gencomp to generate
new insn* files, then you need to run compilei.bat
to generate the cross-compiler. Ignore the
error about compiling winnt.c. Then you can
optionally run comp386.bat if you want to build
a native PDOS/386 compiler (a.out).

To build GCC for 32-bit Windows, you need to
change config.h like this:

#include "uwin.h" /* for Windows PE */
/* #include "pdos386.h" */ /* for a.out */

And then do the above steps, except:
1. Rename the built gcc386.exe to gccwin.exe
after running compilei
2. Run compwin instead of comp386
3. Rename the built gcc-pdos.exe to gccwin.exe
4. Run compwin again and the new gcc-pdos.exe
should be nearly identical to gccwin.exe, and
you can rename gcc-pdos.exe to gccwin.exe
