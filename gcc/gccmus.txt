Release Notes for GCCMUS
------------------------

This document explains what needs to be done to get GCCMVS from:

http://gccmvs.sourceforge.net

to run on MUSIC/SP demo.

The notes for the MVS version of the compiler (gccmvs.txt)
should be read in conjunction with this document. In particlar
the section on conversion from ASCII to EBCDIC is relevant to
MUSIC/SP.



Miscellaneous notes about MUSIC/SP
----------------------------------

The original MUSIC/SP port was done by Dave Edwards, but
he unfortunately died, so Paul Edwards (no relation)
picked it up some time later, with assistance mainly
from Fausto Saporito.

Dave's documentation for the newly-available ATL memory
was scant, and currently the ATL address is simply
hardcoded as 0x2000000 (32 MB), since it appears that
it is not available via a GETMAIN etc call.

Running under Hercules is much faster than running under
SIM390. Also Hercules provides tape facilities which are
not available on SIM390, and the build procedure is based
around this. Testing is normally done under Hercules/380
which has tape enhancements.

The build procedure is basically reliant on the existence
of a MUSIC/390, which is an enhancement to MUSIC/SP Demo,
containing e.g. additional macro options.

MUSIC/390 as its name implies runs on a standard S/390
machine. However, the code model is S/380 (RMODE 24,
AMODE 31).

MUSIC/SP by default pages intensely. This in turn appears
to invoke a presumed bug in Hercules. Changing MAXRRS
from 2000 to 4000 ends the paging, allowing GCC to rebuild
itself on MUSIC/390.

The port is effectively complete, just waiting for someone
to finalize scripts etc to do normal compilation, and
putting things into a library to link with, and testing
the mfarc (and formally producing MUSIC/390). The 
technology itself is proven.

The GCCMUS compiler simply reuses the MVS version, so there
is currently no special __MUSIC__ define to use.  You can
define one yourself as a parameter, or define a MUSIC, as
you wish. The long-term intention is to have a __MUSIC__.



Building
--------

To install from scratch you need to cross-compile from another 
platform. Scripts are provided for MS Windows.

First of all you need to get the source code by:

1. Downloading the GCC base code (as per GCCMVS).

2. Downloading the GCCMVS patch and applying it (as per GCCMVS).


You then need to set the configuration properly.

There are 2 distinct MUSIC/SP programming environments possible:

1. Normal 24-bit. This is the S370 environment.

2. RMODE 24, AMODE 31 with a chunk of ATL memory available for
you to manage yourself. This is the S380 environment using
MEMMGR.


You can build the cross-compiler and then produce the
assembler code and then have that transferred via tape
to MUSIC/390 by running the "allmus.bat" file (after
inspecting it for any required modifications).

Don't worry about the fact that the executable is called
gccmvs.exe and the batch file is also called mvs.  The
name is shared, but they are different.



Version
-------

To find out version, you can go:

/parm --version
/load xmon
gcc n(gcc.lmod) lcparm
